# Debug Instructions

## Current Issues
1. Terminal commands are not providing output
2. Buttons and routing not working according to user
3. Need to isolate the root cause

## Steps Taken
1. Temporarily disabled Convex provider
2. Temporarily disabled AI components 
3. Created a test page at /test

## Next Steps
1. Try to access the application in browser at http://localhost:3000
2. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
3. Test the /test page for basic button functionality
4. Re-enable features one by one

## If buttons still don't work:
1. Check if JavaScript is loaded properly
2. Check for CSS conflicts preventing clicks
3. Check for overlay elements blocking interactions
4. Verify React hydration is working correctly

## Files Modified in This Session
- .env.local - Fixed environment variables
- ClientProviders.tsx - Temporarily disabled Convex
- page.tsx - Temporarily disabled AI components
- Created test/page.tsx for debugging

## User's Original Issue
"buttons are not working and no proper routing in pages"

This suggests either:
1. JavaScript not loading/executing
2. CSS issues preventing clicks
3. React hydration errors
4. Routing configuration problems
5. Event handlers not attaching properly
